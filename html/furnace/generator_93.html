<h3>GENERATOR (Aug93) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; furnace</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
generator --- backup generator start procedure
<p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
This is the procedure for starting the Aggreko diesel generators to provide 
backup power to the oven.  This version was originally written by
P. Esterline and J. Hill in 1992; revised 13AUG93.
<p>
The generators should be started anytime there is a power failure or a serious
threat of a power failure.  At least one of them will be running continuously
while the oven is rotating at high temperature.
<p>

<h3>STARTUP PROCEDURE</h3>
<p>
<p>
 A) Remove Load
<br>
Check the breakers inside the lab to be sure the load
of the oven has been disconnected from the generator circuits with the
breakers on GSB0 and GSB1.
(See "8 Meter Furnace Power Manual")

<p>
<p>
 B) Battery Power
<br>
Turn the generator battery on with the red switch on the floor on the
right side of the engine.  (If we have a battery charger, it should
always be on during casting.)  The lights in the enclosure should come
on if the switch at the door is on (but it has a delay timer).

<p>
<p>
 C) Fluid Check
<br>
Check the fuel (sight tube on right side of the engine), water (sight
tube outside the enclosure) and oil levels (dipstick on left side of
engine).  Make sure the fuel valve is on (yellow handle on floor on
left side of engine).

<p>
<p>
 D) Start
<br>
Turn the startup switch (off/run/start) from off to run to start.  (It works
just like your car.)  Check for alarm indicators on the panel.  

<p>
<p>
 E) Warm-up
<br>
Run the generator for 10 to 15 minutes before applying load.  Lower the oven
power panel load limits as required.  In an emergency, the time it takes for
you to switch the inside breakers will be long enough.

<p>
<p>
 F) Frequency
<br>
The frequency meters should read 56 - 57 Hz at start-up and should be increased
to 60 Hz after running a few minutes.

<p>
<p>
 G) Connect 
<br>
Press the red breaker button to close the circuit breaker to put the
generator on line (as long as everything is ready inside the lab).

<p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
<p>
<p>
 Circuit Breaker
<br>
Some of these generators have a manual circuit breaker and some have an
automatic breaker.  The breaker is in the silver control box behind the
alarm panel.

<p>
<p>
 Emergency Shut-off
<br>
The emergency shut-off switch is the red push button on the outside of the
enclosure near the generator door.

<p>
<p>
 Fuel
<br>
Each generator has a 600 gallon tank with two fill ports.  Fuel consumption
is about 32 gallons/hour at full load.  Watch fuel levels; If it runs out
of fuel, a service call is required.

<p>
<p>
 Problems
<br>
If service is needed, call Loftin Equipment Co. in Phoenix at
(602) 272-9466  (24 hours).

<p>

<h3>SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE</h3>
<p>
<p>
 V) Remove Load
<br>
Remove the load with the breakers inside the lab.

<p>
<p>
 W) Open Breaker
<br>
Open the generator breaker by pressing the green button.

<p>
<p>
 X) Frequency
<br>
Lower the speed so the frequency is about 57 Hz.

<p>
<p>
 Y) Turn Off
<br>
Turn the off/run/start switch to off.

<p>
<p>
 Z) Battery
<br>
Turn off the red battery switch to reduce the risk of running the
battery down.

<p>
<p>

<h3>BUGS</h3>
The south generator (August 1993) has no water level sight tube on the
radiator.
The south generator does not have lights on the red and green circuit
breaker buttons.
