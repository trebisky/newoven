<h3>HARDWARE OVERVIEW</h3>
	The Oven is about 9.5 m. or 384 in.  diameter, by about seven
feet tall inside.  There are 252 heaters covering the interior which
can deliver over 193 kW.  We can heat the Oven to 1200 C., and can
hold its temperature constant to +- 0.5 C.  in the anneal range.  It
can spin at 10 rpm for days on end.
<p>

<h3>NOMENCLATURE</h3>
	The Oven is composed of several parts and subsystems, for
which it is useful for us all to use the same names.  The heated
interior cavity of the Oven is formed by installing the Shell,
consisting of Lid, Cone, and Walls, upon the Hearth.  The Hearth is
the floor of silicon carbide plates.  The cavity is heated by Heaters
on all surfaces.  On the Shell, there are two heater Panels wired
together in series to form each Heater circuit. In the Hearth, each
Heater is a single coil of wound kanthal wire laying in grooves
beneath the silicon carbide plates.  There are two sets of Heaters in
the hearth, the Primary Heaters are larger, heavier, coils designed to
deliver maximum power, to heat to high temperature.  The Anneal
Heaters are smaller, more delicate coils that reside beneath the
Primaries.  They are for low power slow cooling, to deliver smoother,
more controlled heat.  Each Heater circuit is designated by its
three-digit PFE number.  PFE stands for Power panel (0-9), Fase (sic)
in its panel (0-2), and Element number (0-29).  Outside of the Shell,
or under the Hearth, there is a Junction Box associated with each
heater, with its PFE in big yellow numbers.  A thick black Twistlock
Cable emerges from each Junction Box, and goes to the appropriate
Twistlock Recepticle for each Heater.  Power to each Twistlock
Receptical is switched by one Element in a Power Panel.  Each Element
is composed of an solid state relay, or SSR, and its associated fuse
and circuit breaker.  There is a Voltage Sensor (VS), a Local Current
Sensor (LCS), and a Remote Current Sensor (RCS) associated with each
Heater.  The VCSs and LCSs are checked to see that the SSRs are
switching correctly, and the RCSs are checked to assure that the power
is going to the correct Heater.  Power from the outside world is
supplied to the nine Power Panels (PP0-8), through large Slip Rings,
which allow juice to flow while the Oven is spinning.  This power
comes from some combination of four sources, Main SwitchBoard 0
(MSB0), Main SwitchBoard 1 (MSB1), Generator SwitchBoard 0 (GSB0), and
Generator SwitchBoard 1 (GSB1).  MSB0 is a 750kVA line from TEP Co.,
MSB1 is a 500kVA line, and GSB0 &1 are from two 500kVA generators.
<p>
	Scattered around the Oven are lots of Thermocouples, or TCs,
which read temperature.  TCs are thin metal tubes with two special
metal wires inside that are joined at the tip of the tube.  It is
filled with an insulating powder.  Each TC has a color-coded connector
on the end with three pins.  Our normal type-N TCs are orange.  Each
TC is plugged into a special gold or orange TC Connector Cable which
is designated by a four-digit DNTX number. DNTX stands for DCU (0-5),
DCU card Number (0-5), TIC select number (0-3), and channel (X) on the
TIC (0-4).  Not every possible DNTX (or PFE) number is currently in
use.  The Connector Cable connects each TC to its Isothermal Junction
Box, or IJB.  Each IJB is a copper block with ten TC junctions and two
thermistors attached to it, thermally isolated in a foam-rubber filled
box.  Each IJB is serviced by two TICs, whose DNT numbers are
emblazoned on the cover of the box.  The TICs live in seven
Temperature Instrumentation Panels, or TIPs.  Information from the
TICs is directed through six Data Conversion Units, DCU 0-5, to the
on-board computers.
<p>
	The Oven is propelled around by two independent Drive systems,
Drive 1 and Drive 2.  Each Drive consists of a 40 horsepower motor,
the electrical system to start and protect them, a gearbox, and pinion
gear.  Both Drives are controlled by the Rotation Control Panel
<p>
	There are three computers which live aboard the oven to read
and process temperature information, and to control the heaters.  They
are CPU0, CPU1, and CPU2.  Besides sending instructions to the Power
Panels to switch Heaters on and off, they also check to see what the
Voltage (adcV), and Current draw (adcC), are for each Fase, and the
current on the Neutral (adcN), of each Power Panel.  In addition, the
CPU sisters communicate with the two Control Room Computers, Crater
and Dorado, which store data and serve as interface with you, the Oven
Pilot.

<h3>WHERE PARTS ARE</h3>
	All points of interest on the oven are described by regular
cylindrical coordinates R, radial distance in inches from the Oven's
center of rotation, Theta (T), measured clockwise (when viewed from
above) in degrees around the circle from 0 to 360, and Z, measured in
inches above or below the Hearth, which is defined as Z=0.  The
Heaters position is the approximate center of their areas, and a TCs
position is the coordinates of its tip.  For example: Heater 108 is at
(192,98,36). This puts it in the upper wall section of the Shell,
about quarter way around from zero degrees. and three feet up from the
Hearth.
<p>
	There are ports for four Video Cameras in the Cone at 70, 100,
215, and 340 degrees (not all cameras may be installed at any given
time).  Lights for the Video are mounted in the walls at 85, 175, 265,
and 355 degrees.
 
	Each of the Shells Heaters Twistlock cable drops from its
Junction Box to one of the main beams where they plug into their
assigned Twistlock receptacles. These are numbered for our
convenience, so a Heater has a Beam and Twistlock number to describe
where it plugs in.  For example: our friend Heater 108 has Beam 090,
Twistlock 19 as a home.  In the Hearth, each Heater circuit may
connect to either the Primary (PRI) heater coil, or the Anneal (ANL)
coil.  This choice is made by changing the Twistlock cable which comes
from the beam receptacle to one of two marked receptacles on the
appropriate transition box.  These boxes are hung on unistrut rails
between the beams.
<p>
	All of the information from the Shell IJBs and the Heater RCSs
comes down the thick black cables with braided sheaths to plug into
their appropriate transition boxes, and hence to the TICs and PPs.
<p>
	The Oven electronics are arrayed around the carousel at ground
level (Z=-60), with the Power Panels from Theta = 40 to 160 degrees,
the access door into the pedestal at 180 deg., Rotation Control Panel
at 200 deg., Temperature Instrumentation Panels from Theta = 220 to
310 deg., Interface Panel at 320 deg., CPU2 at 340 deg., CPU1 at 350
deg., and CPU0 at 10 degrees.  All of these Panels shall be clearly
marked.
<p>
	Inside the access door there is the Pedestal, upon which is
borne the entire Oven structure.  There is a large crossed-roller
bearing atop the Pedestal, the bottom race of which is toothed on the
outside.  The Drives turn their Pinion Gears around this ring.
Emerging from the floor outside the Pedestal are nine large conduits
which carry the power through the Pedestal walls to the nine sets of
Sliprings, which are stacked on a shaft along the Ovens rotation axis.
Below the large Power Sliprings (deep in the pit) are two sets of much
smaller sliprings which carry low voltage housekeeping power, and
information.  At the bottom of the pit there is also a sump pump...
just in case.
<p>

<h3>GUIDE TO MAPS</h3>
	There exist a number of maps which show the location of every
Heater, TC, IJB, Camera, and Light.  These are located in the control
room, the electronics shop, and out on the wall near the Oven.  These
are all subsets of a master AUTOCAD drawing called HEAT.DWG, copies of
which reside on the Video Computer, and on floppy in the box nearby.
This drawing has many layers which contain lots of obscure but useful
information.  There are also drawings which show oven wiring in
schematic representation. (need names and numbers here.. see Index to
Oven Schematics below)
