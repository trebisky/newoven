<h3>HEATER (Apr97) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; furnace</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
heater --- oven heater power algorithm
<p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
Each of the heater circuits in the oven has its power output level
controlled by a Proportional-Integral-Derivative servo algorithm.  The
temperature derived from a group of assigned "neighboring"
thermocouples is compared to the desired "scheduled" temperature and
power is applied accordingly.
<p>
The oven heater power control system provides for computer control
of the temperature via 9 power panels, each panel controlling
30 heaters of 7800 watts.  The heaters from each power panel are
evenly distributed throughout the oven's base, walls and lid.  The
power is switched with Crydom solid-state relays (SSR) rated at 480
volts, 50 amps which are mounted on forced air cooled heat sinks.
<p>
Each microprocessor controlled power panel communicates with a main
on-board VME computer by ASCII serial data through fiber optic cables.
The VME computer contains the PID algorithm and tells the control
panels which heaters to turn on or off.  It then accepts the sense
information if voltage is on to the heaters and if current is supplied
both at the panel and at the heater.  The command status is updated
four times per second for each of the 30 solid state relay circuits.
Current and voltage status are readback after each command.  Each
microcontroller is powered by the power source which supplies the
heaters being controlled.
<p>
The current minute's power level for each heater element is broken
into quarter second periods of full power or no power.  The on periods
are distributed throughout the minute so as to even the total load on
each circuit of ten heater elements.  Voltage and current sensors are
used on each heater circuit to verify that the heater elements have
indeed switched on or off at the moment commanded by the computer.
Each of the power panel micros can turn any particular heater on or
off every quarter second. Thus, the heaters have a dynamic range of
240 within a minute.  To avoid surges of current use followed by the
current being off for part of each minute, the power panel micro
smooths the load so that a constant number of heaters (modulo 1) is on
for each phase during the minute.  When several heaters are demanding
power for only a fraction of a minute, these are interlaced or
alternated according to the parameter "Fase Epsilson" which gives the
typical timescale that a heater circuit should be on during the
minute.
<p>

<h3>SERVO ALGORITHM</h3>
<p>
Once a minute, a power level for each heater element is calculated
from a weighted average of its neighboring thermocouple temperatures,
and the temperature called for at the current point in the schedule of
temperature versus time.  A proportional, integral, derivative (PID)
servo algorithm is used calculate the desired power level.  A one
quadrant servo is used since losses through the insulation of the
furnace provide a significant cooling loss.  There are separate
temperature versus time schedules for each of several zones of heater
elements.
<p>
The P-error (etmp - htmp) is multiplied by the P-coefficient to give
the P-product in heater power units.  This power request is
"proportional" to the present error in temperature compared to the
schedule. The same is done to get the I-product by integrating over a
specified number of lookback minutes, and the D-product by seeing how
the error has changed since the previous minute.  If the sum of these
three products is less than the Power Limit for that heater, this is
the hpwr applied to the heater.  If the sum is greater, then the
request is clipped to be no greater than the Power Limit.  If all the
10 heaters on a single phase request more heat than can be accomodated
by Fase Max Load, then the hpwr request is clipped even further to
keep the load within the limit for than phase.  After all these
calculations, the Requested Power (hpwr) reported is what actually got
sent to the heater.
