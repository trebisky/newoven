<h3>LOGBOOK (Aug93) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; furnace</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
logbook --- electronic oven logbook, alias ovenlog
<p>

<h3>ELECTRONIC LOGBOOK</h3>
	We are going to try making an electronic logbook during the
next firing.  Our June 1991 experiment in this area was only partially
successful, mostly because of computer limitations at that time. The
concept is that instead of writing in the paper logbook, you send an
email message to a user named "ovenlog".  This produces a text file
which can be read back or printed out.  We will want to continue with
the paper log as well since files can be erased.
<p>
The motivation for the computerized log book is primarily so that
John, Skip, Mark and the other pilots can read the log remotely.
It should also allow us to search more effectively back through old
logbooks.  It is often desirable to find the last time TC 4352 was
acting up.
<p>
You should enter the same items in the log as before:
<pre>
	a) when you arrived and departed
	b) what you checked
	c) any unusual activities you observed
	d) any errors
	e) summary of oven conditions
	f) dial indicator readings
	g) interesting poetry
</pre>
The idea is that the next shift or someone next year can concisely
understand everything that happened on your watch.
If your shift was boring, you might only send 1 message.  If lots of things
are happening, there might be dozens of messages per shift.
<p>

<h3>LOGBOOK ENTRY</h3>
 To make a logbook entry, click twice on the mailtool icon, then click
the "compose, new" button to start a composition window.  Then you
type in your mail message with "To: ovenlog" and "Cc: pilot".  You
don't have to be logged in as pilot to send email to ovenlog, so
anybody can do it.  The logbook entry is just the same as a regular
email message.
<p>
Try to make the "Subject:" entry descriptive and consistent. For example,
all dial indicator readings might have a subject of "dial gauge".
This would allow us to collect all the readings from a run into a file
using grep or match.
<p>
Times and dates are automatically added to mail, so you don't have to worry
about that unless the time is different from when you sent the mail.
<p>
Feel free to send practice messages to the log or to me before the
next firing begins.
<p>

<h3>READING THE LOGBOOK</h3>
 You can read the electronic logbook just like you read regular email
with mailtool except that you use the "ovenlog" mailtool icon on the
pilot's screen instead of the normal "mailtool" mailtool. Click once
with the right mouse button to select a message from the mailbox.
Click twice to read a message.  (see below for other ways to read the log.)
Don't worry, you can't destroy the old messages in the ovenlog.
<p>
Click "Done" if you are finished reading mail with mailtool.  If you want to
iconize mailtool in its current state, click the close button in the
upper left corner of the window border.
<p>

<h3>HARDCOPY</h3>
 While you are reading mail, click the "file, print" button to make a
hardcopy of the message on the laser printer.  You can paste this
hardcopy in the paper logbook to save writing.
<p>

<h3>COPYING INFORMATION</h3>
 Because the mailtool uses the openwindows text edit format, you can
copy text from one window to another.  For example, if you see an
error message in the red window, you can highlight the message in that
window by pointing and clicking.  Then you hit the "copy" key.  Move
the mouse to the mailtool window and hit the "paste" key.  Once you
have learned how to do this, you will never write down an error
message by hand again.
<p>
You can also move mail messages into or out of files by dragging them 
to/from the filemanger window.
<p>

<h3>OTHER OPTIONS</h3>
If you are not running openwindows you can use the "Berkeley" mailer
by saying "mail ovenlog" and type your message terminated with a
<cntrl-Z>.  Or you can use PCNFS to send mail from a PC.  
<p>
To read the logbook file, say:
<pre>
	cl> mail -f ovenlog
</pre>
Or you can page the file /u3/ovenlog/Mail/ovenlog.
Unix tail can be used to continuously show you the last page of a file.
<pre>
	cl> !tail -f /u3/ovenlog/Mail/ovenlog
(^C to exit from tail)
</pre>
<p>

<h3>BUGS</h3>
The "ovenlog" mailtool will complain if you do something that could
modify a message.
