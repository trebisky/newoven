<p>
For the second 6.5m Prefire and later firings we have installed pairs
of LVDTs at 4 azimuths on the oven to measure the aluminum and hearth
radii.  We have also installed 2 pairs of LVDTs on the Inconel bands.
In September 98 for the third 6.5m casting, we installed two more
pairs of LVDTs on the Inconel bands.
Viewing the results of these measurements is tricky for at
least three reasons:
<p>
	1) We use the rotation A/D board in computer v0 to record the
data each minute.  The oven menu software thinks these are rotation
A/D voltages.  So to read the current values, look in the menu for
Zone R.  They also don't display quite full precision on the menus.
<p>
	2) The LVDTs measure voltages with 12 bit resolution from -10
VDC (0) to +10VDC (4096).  For the LVDTs with 2-inch travel, this
corresponds to 1 volt = 0.1 inches.  Thus, the raw A/D readings must
be multiplied by some scale factors. We normally want to convert this
reading to radius of the hearth or to equivalent temperature of the
aluminum plate or to length of the Inconel bands.  The hardwired
scaling factors for the hearth and aluminum plate LVDTs are set to
give readings in degreesC as an equivalent aluminum plate temperature.
This assumes a plate radius of 198 inches and an expansion coefficient
of 24.5e-6 per degree C (MIC 6 tooling plate).  The hardwired scaling
factors for the Inconel band LVDTs give readings in degreesC as an
equivalent band temperature. This assumes a pulley ratio of 0.3831, an
angle of ~13 degrees from the band (for the 6.5m bands), a hot band
length of ~492 inches, and an Inconel expansion coefficient of 11.5e-6
per degreeC. The scaling factors from ADU to the readings on the
screen are listed in mirror$src/oven/oven.h They are 412 and 1618
degrees full scale.
<p>
	3) The LVDT readings have an arbitrary zeropoint offset which
depends on how they were mounted at room temperature.  This cannot be
removed by changing the normal ograph multiplication factors.  To get
rid of this offset you must set the appropriate LVDT offset values in
the Rotation Menu BEFORE the firing begins (before the data is
collected).  If the zeropoint is screwed up, you may need to resort to
the imarith tricks described in the older memo below. Especially the
band LVDTs need to be mechanically set near the end of their +-10VDC
travel before setting the software zeropoints.
<p>
To plot LVDT temperatures, use ograph and set info?="rClvdtN", where C
is the computer number and N is the LVDT number.  So the first LVDT
would be "r0lvdt0" and the last would be "r0lvdt15".  Premade scripts
that work like ograph are available in the scopes.furnace package for
plotting band and aluminum LVDT readings. (see below)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Here's a way to get all the LVDT readings with full precision
for a particular minute.  Only engineers would ever want to do this.
<p>
wtext rotv920219[17:32,1439] STDOUT head-
<p>
Obviously the number on the rotv image changes according to the date.
The 1439 number is the number of the minute in the day (1-1440).
 I.E. 1439 is 2 minutes before midnight.  STDOUT can be changed to the
name of another file if you don't want to print to the screen.
<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now to subtract the zeropoint offsets, you must use imarith on the rotv.....
data images.  Do not do this as "pilot" because there is a large risk that
you will destroy the data altogether.
<p>
From your personal directory (not log'd in as pilot):
<p>
imarith /home/pilot/rotv920401 - /home/hill/rotvzero rotv920401
<p>
will make a zeropoint corrected rotv..... image.  You can now ograph this
in the normal fashion.
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts from scopes.furnace$, glvdt.cl and gband.cl will overplot the
LVDTs on the Z6, or Z3 temperatures.  To use them say "epar glvdt" or 
"epar gband" after loading the scopes.furnace package.
<p>
Sample commands as used in these scripts look like:
<p>
ograph info1=ztmp zone1=z6 info2=etmp zone2=z6 \
info3=ztmp zone3=z4 info4="" append=no
<p>
# LVDT readings scaled to aluminum temperatures.
<p>
# Hearth and Aluminum radius at 350 degrees
ograph info1="" info2="r0lvdt0" info3="r0lvdt1" info4=""  # append=yes
<p>
# Hearth and Aluminum radius at 160 degrees
ograph info1="" info2="r0lvdt2" info3="r0lvdt3" info4=""  # append=yes
<p>
# Hearth and Aluminum radius at 340 degrees

Both the old and the new Inconel Band LVDTs are within a few degrees of
being parallel to the bands.  Nonetheless, we are still running with
the original 6.5m scale factors.  LVDTs 12-15 are scaled to be 50.8 (mm)
full scale.  Multiply by 38 to get nominal degrees K.
(In the future they should be scaled to 1930 to match the other
band LVDTs.)
<p>
Be sure to set all the band LVDTs to a position corresponding
to -9.8 VDC to assure that the have plenty of travel to
accomodate band expansion.
