<h3>MENUS (Jul93) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; furnace</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
menus --- description of configuration and status menus

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	The various menus are grouped in a tree structure.  The arrow
keys are used to move around inside and between menus.  The down arrow
is used to move to the next item in the menu, and the up arrow to the
previous item. The left arrow key is known as the GOTO
key.  This is used slightly differently in different contexts.  It may
be used to go to a sub-menu, or it may be used to "execute" a function
specified by the menu item (as in the Database Menu),  or it may be
used to go to a related menu to the current menu as specified by the
particular menu item.  Example: When in the thermocouple menu, if the
cursor at the menu item indicating the TIC status, one may jump
"sideways" (from one branch of the menu tree structure to another at
the equivalent depth) by merely pressing the GOTO key.  The right
arrow key is the GOBACK function.  It returns you to the previous menu
context.
<p>
	Data is entered using the E and RETURN keys.  If the data
associated with the menu item has only two values (ON/OFF,
Enabled/Disabled, Run/Stop), The value will toggle each time the E key
is pressed.  Otherwise, a value must be entered by first pressing E,
then typing in the value, and finally pressing return.
<p>
	In the lower left corner of the menu screen, several "flags"
may appear.  The letter "E" will appear if there are any normal
(non-priority) error messages pending that have not yet been
acknowledged.  The character "!" will appear if there are any pending
unacknowledged priority errors.  The letter "A" indicates that the
screen is in autoupdate mode.
<p>
	In the bottommost line on the screen, menu error messages
(as oppposed to oven error messages) will appear, explaining more fully the
error you made in using the menu system.  If you make a self-explanatory
error, the menu system will just beep at you.
