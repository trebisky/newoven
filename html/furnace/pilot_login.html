<h3>PILOT_LOGIN (May00) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; furnace</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
pilot_login --- procedure for pilot login and oven startup from console

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
This help file describes the PILOT STARTUP SEQUENCE FOR THE OVEN.
<p>
These instructions assumes that crater (or dorado) is running and that
the oven network is intact.  These instructions also assume that the
on-board VME computers are running.  IRAF parameter defaults only work
for <i>oven0v0</i>.
<p>
See <b>user_login</b> for information about non-pilot or remote logins.
<p>

<h3>WARNING NOTES</h3>
<p>
Do not panic and reboot or logout too hastily.  Rebooting normally
takes about 10 minutes depending on
the condition of the disk.  This login procedure will take at least 3
minutes if you are practiced.  You might get into even more trouble
than you already had.
<p>
Pilot (or Pilot2) should definitely not be running oven on the other
workstation (crater or dorado) at the same time.  This is not
impossible, but it is rather dangerous --- you could destroy the other
database if you make a mistake.
<p>

<h3>STEP 1: login to the console as pilot (on crater) or pilot2 (on dorado).</h3>
<p>
The console login starts with a blank screen that says:
"crater login:" or "dorado login:" along with a Solaris graphic.
<p>
After entering the username and password, this should give you an
openwindows screen with:
<pre>
		- a console window
		- purple xgterm window with IRAF
		- green xgterm window with IRAF
		- red xgterm window with IRAF
		- blue xgterm window with IRAF
		- ximtool (image display)
		- a mailtool (for mail)
		- a clock
	(roughly in that order)
</pre>
It takes about 40 seconds for all the windows to start.
<p>

<h3>STEP 2: Load the external IRAF packages for the oven.</h3>
<p>
This step is no longer needed as the <b>mirror</b> tasks used to run
the oven are loaded automatically when the pilot logs in.  (see loginuser.cl)
<p>
However, you may still load the <b>mirror</b>
package in each xgterm window if you prefer.
<p>
<p>

<br>
<p>
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
cl> mirror
mi>
</pre>

<p>
The "mi>" prompt indicates that the <b>mirror</b> package is loaded.
Type "?" for a list of the tasks in the active package (the last one loaded
from the command line).
<p>
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> ?
      odisp  oven    ovend   oveng   ovenr   tcmark  
      ograph ovenb   ovene   ovenp   ovenw   
mi> 
</pre>

<p>
If you have not loaded the <b>mirror</b> package, you can still get a
list of the tasks in the package by saying "help mirror" or "help
mirror option=dir".
<p>

<p>
<p>

<h3>STEP 3: Create shared memory segments if needed</h3>
<p>
Shared memory segments must be created and initialized first. 
Check these with "ipcs".  There should be 3 segments, one each for on-board
computers oven0v0, oven0v1 and oven0v2.  And with Solaris 2.6 there are
sometimes other segments.
<p>
<p>
 Example (that's OK):
<br>
<pre>
mi> !ipcs
IPC status from <running system> as of Wed Sep  9 13:13:47 1998
Message Queue facility not in system.
T         ID      KEY        MODE        OWNER    GROUP
Shared Memory:
m          0   0x50000d40 --rw-r--r--     root     root
m          1   00000000 --rw-rw-rw-  dwatson    other
m          2   0x00000100 --rw-r--r--    pilot    other
m          3   0x00000101 --rw-r--r--    pilot    other
m          4   0x00000102 --rw-r--r--    pilot    other
Semaphores:
mi>
</pre>

<p>
If shared memory segments do not exist, the <b>oven</b> task will create and
initialize (fill with zeros) them.  The shared memory segments can
only be created by the pilot.  Run the <b>oven</b> task for all three
computers as shown below.  (use the blue window) Before you "exit"
from each <b>oven</b>, use the "Database" menu to "Read parameters from
disk".  If you know that you have "good" parameters in the
v-computers, you could "Read parameters from oven" instead.  "Read
parameters from disk" should always work, but could give you clock
settings that are hours or even days old.
<p>
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> oven ncomp=0	(Exit)
mi> oven ncomp=1	(Exit)
mi> oven ncomp=2	(Exit)
mi>
</pre>

<p>
<p>

<br>
If an <b>oven</b> task crashes, use <b>flpr</b> to flush the process cache before
restarting.  
<p>
<b>unlearn oven</b> resets the default parameters for the task.
<i>oven.readonly</i> must be "no" (which is not the default) to modify
shared memory segments or the database file.  And <i>oven.remove</i>
must be "no" to make a permanent shared memory segment.  If you leave
<i>oven.readonly</i> as "yes", you will get the message "hoven error
30".
<p>
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> unlearn oven
mi> oven.readonly=no
mi> oven ncomp=0
</pre>


<p>

<h3>STEP 4:  Kill any stray background data, parameter and error daemons.</h3>
<p>
<p>
Check for all pilot tasks by using: 
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> !ps -efc | grep pilot 
mi>
</pre>

Oven tasks appear as "/iraf/mirror/bin.ssun/x_mirror.e".  The
<b>cl</b>s in your xgterm windows appear as "/iraf/iraf/bin.ssun/cl.e",
while the xgterm itself appears as "xgterm -name ovenBlue .......".
Note that each background daemon has an associated <b>cl</b> which
appears as "/iraf/iraf/bin.ssun/cl.e -d /home/pilot/uparm/bkg553b".
<p>
If you only want to check for the oven tasks, you can say:
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> !ps -efc | grep mirror |sort	(shows all mirror tasks)
mi>
</pre>

If you aren't sure, kill all pilot "mirror" tasks (and their parent
PIDs) and start clean.  Killing a daemon may cause its associated
<b>cl</b> task to go into a loop and use a lot of CPU time.
<p>
If you only want to check for the background tasks, you can say:
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> !ps -efc | grep bkg |sort	(shows all IRAF background tasks)
mi>
</pre>

<p>
<p>
To kill tasks, use the Unix command:
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> !kill -9 xxxx
</pre>

Where xxxx is the PID number displayed by ps.
PID in this case means Process IDentifcation,
not Proportional, Integral, Derivative.
<p>
<p>

<br>
	Hint: Always use care when killing tasks.  It is particularly
unproductive to kill the window you are working in.  It is also
recommended that you kill or spawn tasks when the clock is between 30
and 45 seconds after the minute.  This avoids starting or stopping
tasks while they are communicating.  Try to use the IRAF <b>kill</b>
command whenever possible.
<p>
Advanced users who are interested in a rapid kill may wish to try
<b>scopes.furnace.killer</b> from J. Hill's <b>scopes</b> external IRAF
package. It is fast, but dangerous.
<p>
<p>


<h3>STEP 5:  Start the new data and parameter daemons.</h3>
<p>
Now you are ready to start the daemons in the blue window:
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> ovenp &
mi> ovenb &
	(if you are coldstarting, turn on the on-oven VME computers here)
mi> ovend & 
mi> oven readonly=no
</pre>

<p>
<p>

<br>
The blue window will now continue the <b>oven</b> program talking to
the shared memory segment for oven0v0.  If the oven0v0 computer is
functioning, you should get fresh data each minute.
<p>
For a brief description of the daemon's function type: <b>help ovenp</b>
<p>
<p>
	Hint: Beware of parameter database synchronization problems
after wierd scenarios.  One possible problem occurs if the VME
computers booted before the oven daemons were running.  Download
parameters to the oven	(and double check clock parameters). 

<p>
<p>

<br>
	Hint: Don't start background jobs if they are already running!  
The old daemons should have been killed off in the previous step.
If there is a duplicate daemon already running, you will get an
error message like: "poven error -3".

<p>

<h3>STEP 6:	Start the error daemons.</h3>
<p>
You are never really secure unless you have your error daemons running.
<p>
Start these four daemons in the red window:
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> ovene ncomp=0 offset=10 & 
mi> ovene ncomp=1 offset=11 &
mi> ovene ncomp=2 offset=12 &
mi> oveng & 
mi> oven offset=14
</pre>

Set the <b>oven</b> program in the red window to read the error log.
<p>
<p>

<br>
<p>
To verify which background tasks are running in a particular xgterm
window, use the IRAF <b>jobs</b> command.
<p>
 Example from the blue window:
<br>
<pre>
mi> jobs
    [1] 1473:50  Running   ovenb & 
    [2] 1473:38  Running   ovenp & 
    [3] 1407:02  Running   ovend & 
mi>
</pre>


<p>

<h3>STEP 7: Start the oven cron task.</h3>
<p>
Start the cron task in the purple window:
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> ovenc &
</pre>

ograph and odisp should now display data at appropriate intervals.
<p>
<p>

<br>
 
To stop the cron task or another daemon, use the IRAF <b>kill</b>
command in the relevant window: <b>kill</b> x
(where x is the job number [1-4])

<p>

<h3>STEP 8: Start the <b>ovenr</b> daemons.</h3>
<p>
Start the two <b>ovenr</b> daemons in the green window.  These are only needed
during fast rotation --- they log the measured rotation speed in a
file every 6 seconds.
<p>
<p>
 Example:
<br>
<pre>
mi> ovenr connection="oven0v0,5107" > rspeed.oven0v0 &
mi> ovenr connection="oven0v2,5107" > rspeed.oven0v2 &
mi>
</pre>

<p>
If the rspeed file exists, you will have to change the > to a >> in order
to append to a file.  Then to view the rspeed file on the green window
screen, start a Unix tail task "!tail -f rspeed.oven0v0".  You may stop
this tail task with a ^C without any interuption to the <b>ovenr</b> daemons.
<p>

<h3>Other useful commands:</h3>
<p>
To check the communication links, use "!netstat -f inet".
<p>
To remove a shared memory segment, use "!ipcrm -m xxx".
<p>
To check the available swap space, use "!swap -s".
<p>
To check the available disk space and to see which disks are
mounted, use "!df".  To see the disk use in the current directory, use
"!du".
<p>
To make a hardcopy of a window, use "!xwd |xpr -device ps |lp".
If the window is white on black use "!xwd |xpr -device ps -rv |lp" to reverse
it.  (These commands are usually aliased to "hc" and "hr".)
<p>
To logoff from the console, select "Exit" from the Rootmenu and then confirm
your selection when prompted.
(The oven pilot should never need to logoff, except for software changes
or workstation failure.)
