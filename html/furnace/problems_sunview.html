<h3>NAME</h3>
problems --- description of common problems with the oven screen

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
	This help file describes some of the most frequently encountered
problems with the oven window system.  The recommended solutions are
also given.  If any of these problems reoccur frequently, you may be doing
something wrong.
<p>
<p>
 cl dies
<br>
	If you accidently type control-X in a window, you will suspend
that window's process and you will see the message:
<p>
<pre>
Stopped.
dorado% 
</pre>
<p>
	If you type the Unix command <b>jobs</b> at this point, you
will see your stopped job.  The correct response at this point is to
give the command <b>fg</b> to bring the previous task back to the
foreground. Your process will continue where it left off. 

<p>
<p>
 window wrong size
<br>
	If you accidently resize one of the windows with the colored border,
you should press function key R2 to restore it to its proper 34 line size.
Window size can also be changed by pressing the "control" key and the middle
mouse button simultaneously while the mouse is on the window border.

<p>
<p>
 window dies
<br>
	If a window dies completely, move the mouse to the gray
background area and press the right mouse button to get the Rootmenu.
Select the window type that you wish to recreate.  Note that this does
not RESET a window; it creates a new one.  Be sure that the old window
is not still around; otherwise you could wind up with two copies of
the same window, which is bad news.  Remember the window could be
hidden or closed somewhere.
<p>
	The most frequent window to die is <b>imtool</b>, which cannot deal
with talking to two tasks at once.  You therefore should be careful
not to run <b>odisp</b> while a <b>ovenc</b> is running.
<p>
  To intentionally quit a window, move the mouse to the windows top
border and hold down the right mouse button.  Select the frame submenu
and select QUIT.

<p>
<p>
 syntax errors
<br>
	If you start getting lots of syntax errors from an IRAF
window, try giving the cl command <b>flpr</b>.  Otherwise, <b>log</b>
out of IRAF, and exit the dorado shell.  Then restart the window as
above.

<p>
<p>
 frozen windows
<br>
	If a gterm window "freezes up", it could be because you hit
256 characters without hitting a carriage return.  This usually occurs
when you accidentally lean on the keyboard.  The window will just beep
at you when you try to enter more characters. control-C fixes this
problem.  Sometimes just using the <b>continue</b> item from the top menu
will free up the window.

<p>
<p>
 capital letters 
<br>
	If your gterm window starts giving you only capital letters,
even when Caps Lock is off, you will probably find that the upper
border of the window says "[CAPS]".  Function key "F1" toggles this
function.

<p>
<p>
 screwy cursor keys
<br>
	If you are using <b>ograph</b> or something else in the
graphics section of a gterm window, and you quit the window while
<b>=gcur</b> is active, then the cursor keys will not work in the text
part of the gterm window unless you put on caps lock.  This can also
occur if you control-C out of <b>=gcur</b>.  The solution is to go to the
submenu at the top of the gterm window and say "Show graph".  Once the
graph is rexposed, you can exit the <b>=gcur</b> normally with a "q"
and everything will be back to normal.

<p>
<p>
 mouse button initialization for imcur
<br>
	When pilot first logs in the mouse buttons are not initialized.
This means that if you attempt to access imcur from the <b>oven</b> program
to find an oven location, you cannot use the left mouse button to return.
Use "t" or "l" or "w" or "b" to return from the imtool.
	To initialize the mouse button, enter "=imcur" from the blue window.
Then type "t" in the imtool to return.  Then enter "=imcur" again in the 
blue window.  Then type <cntrl-left-mouse-button> twice.  Now clicking
the left mouse button will return the relevant r-theta-z coordinates.
