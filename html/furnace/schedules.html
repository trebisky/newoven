<h3>SCHEDULES (Aug93) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; furnace</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
schedules --- oven schedule description and editing procedure
<p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	Once a minute, a power level for each heater element is
calculated from a weighted average of its neighboring thermocouple
temperatures, and the temperature called for at the current point in
the schedule of temperature versus time.  There are separate
temperature versus time schedules for each of several zones of heater
elements as well as the rotation speed.  These schedules can be
interlocked so as to synchronize their progress according to real
temperature data.
<p>
	Oven schedules consist of nodes which are composed of a
GOALTIME and a GOALTEMP.  The node also has a LABEL and some wait
conditions which allow the schedules of various zones to be
syncronized.  The parameters and data for the current node of each
active zone schedule are shown in the 'Oven Overview' menu.
Additional details for the current node are shown in each of the
'Zone' menus.  The full schedule for a particular zone is shown
in the 'Zone Schedule' menu.
<p>

<h3>WARNING</h3>
	Changing the schedule on the fly is very dangerous.  Do not
attempt it unless you are very sure that you know what you are doing.
<p>

<h3>SCHEDULE EDITING</h3>
	Temperature schedules may be editted by the <b>oven</b> task in
the 'Configuration and Status Menu'.  Move to the 'Zone' menu, the
press GOTO at the 'Zone ID' to get to the 'Zone Schedule' menu.  To
edit a node, use the UP or DOWN keys to point the cursor at the node
you wish to edit.  Then use 'P' to cache the parameters.  To change
the GOALTEMP, press the 'e' key and enter a temperature at the prompt
followed by return.  To delete the node, enter 'del' at the prompt.
To insert a node above the one you are pointed at, enter 'ins' at the
prompt.  To append a node, point the cursor at the first blank line
beyond the end of the schedule, and use the insert function.
<p>
	To edit other node items use the GOTO key to the 'Node' menu
page for the node you are editing.  Use the UP or DOWN keys to move
to the value that you wish to edit; press 'e', type the new value, and
press return to change the value.  When you change a parameter,
other related parameters are automatically updated to reflect your change
i.e. change GOALTEMP and RATE, GOAL CLOCK TIME, DELTA TEMP, and DELTA CLOCK
TIME are all updated immediately. When you are done changing values,
use the 'W' key to write the changes to the oven or discard them
(press GOTO at the option you choose).  All affected nodes will THEN
be updated and NOT before.  Schedule changes should be saved between
30 and 45 seconds after the minute to avoid disrupting the schedule
computation.
<p>
	These instructions apply to all the schedule parameters except
the biparameters for clock time and clock status.  See <b>help
clocks</b> for instructions on how to change the clocks. The clocks
tend to get out of sync when the schedule is edited, so we need to
check them after changes are made.  If you edit the current node, the
schedule editor will display the appropriate time to set the clocks to at
the top of the screen.
(This applies to editing, not to copying schedules.)
<p>

<h3>SCHEDULE COPYING</h3>
	While pointing at the schedule labels,
<pre>
"Lab  Rate  Dev  GTemp  Gtime  DTemp  Dtime  Wait"
</pre>
you may copy over a schedule from another zone, OVERWRITING the
current schedule in this zone.  To do this, type 'e', type the
zone address, and press return again.  Remember that zone addresses
are: 
<pre>
Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 Z4 Z5 Z6 Z7 Z8 Z9 Z10 ......... R
</pre>
<p>
	Be careful not to confuse zone R with node label 'r'.  Node labels
are optional for all nodes not involved with wait states.  Labels are highly
recommended for clarity.  In the rotation zone, the parameters have special
meanings:
<pre>
                Sch Temp = scheduled rotation speed (RPM)
                Avg Temp = measured rotation speed (RPM)
                Error    = Error (scheduled-measured)
                Rate     = rate (RPM/hr)
</pre>
<p>

<h3>SCHEDULE PARAMETERS</h3>
<p>
 Node Label
<br>
	A lowercase or uppercase letter to identify each node in the
schedule.  For example 'b' or 'B'.  A '*' appearing next to the label
indicates that this is the active node.  Note that labels need not be
sequential.  You may edit them to appear in any order.

<p>
 Rate (C/hr)
<br>
	The rate of change of scheduled temperature for this node.
Note that the units are (degrees per hour) not (degrees per minute).
The scheduled temperature changes at this rate until reaching the goal
temperature for the current node.

<p>
 Deviation  (degrees C)
<br>
	This is the permissible difference between the scheduled temperature
and the computed heater temperature or zone average temperature.
Deviation is also used as a parameter for one of the wait states.

<p>
 Tdeviation  (degrees C)
<br>
	This is the new deviation parameter used to identify discrepant
thermocouples in reference to their neighbors.

<p>
 Goal  Temperature (degrees C)
<br>
	Goal temperature is where the schedule should be when it finishes
a particular node.

<p>
 Goal  Clock Time (dd:hh:mm)
<br>
	Zone clock time at the end of the node.

<p>
 Delta Temperature (degrees C)
<br>
	Amount the temperature changes during this node.  This is
redundant with Goal Temperature, Goal Time and Rate so the schedule
editor calculates the other parameters hierarchically when you specify
one of them.

<p>
 Delta Clock Time (dd:hh:mm)
<br>
	Amount the zone clock time changes during this node, or the
length of the node not including wait states.

<p>
 Wait on Tolerance (Yes/No)
<br>
	Should the schedule wait until the average temperature of the zone
is within 1 degree of the scheduled temperature?

<p>
 Wait on Deviation (Yes/No)
<br>
	Should the schedule wait until the scatter in the zone is less than
the scheduled deviation?

<p>
 Wait on Zone/Node (Yes/No)
<br>
	Should the schedule wait until some other zone has reached a specified
point?

<p>
 Wait on Zone ID (ID) (Z0-Z18,R,A)
<br>
	The name of the zone to wait on. (A to wait on all zones)

<p>
 Wait on Node Label (label) (a-z,A-Z)
<br>
	The label of the node to wait on.  Labels are not automatically
 assigned.  The pilot is responsible for keeeping them aligned in the schedule.

<p>
 Proportional Coef. (power units per degree)
<br>
	If the heater temperature is less than the scheduled temperature by
one degree, apply this many power units to the heater for the next minute.

<p>
 Integral Coef. (power units per degree)
<br>
	If the integrated heater temperature error is
one degree, apply this many power units to the heater for the next minute.

<p>
 Derivative Coef. (power units per degree)
<br>
	If the heater temperature error (compared to the previous minute) 
increases by one degree, apply this many power units to the heater for
the next minute.

<p>
 Integral Depth (minutes)
<br>
	Depth of the leaky memory to integrate the heater temperature error.

<p>
 Power Limit (power units) (0-240)
<br>
	Maximum number of power units to apply to a heater in the next minute.
180 units gives a 75% duty cycle to the heater.

<h3>SYNCHRONIZATION</h3>
<p>
This is an example of how the heated oven zones wait for the mold to
reach a specified temperature and then resynchronize the clocks.
First the mold zone stops and waits for tolerance (T, 1 degree error)
at node d with T=475.  Meanwhile, the other zones continue ramping to
T=500 where they stop and wait for zone 5 to finish node d.  If the
other zones had stopped to wait at node d, then it would take an
arbitrarily long time for the mold to reach T=475 in an oven at T=475.
After the mold reaches T=475 and starts node e, the other zones begin
node f (in this case, a hold).  Node f is made only 1 minute long so
all zones wait there until zone 5 finishes node e and catches up to
the same clock time.  The synchronization hold must be only 1 minute
long so all zones begin and end the node on the same minute.

</pre>
<p>

<h3>BUGS</h3>
The schedule displays only show the rate to 1 decimal place.  Thus if
the rate was entered as 0.125 degrees/hour, it shows as 0.1.  The schedule
runs correctly at 0.125 even when the display says 0.1.
