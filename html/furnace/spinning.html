<h3>SPINNING (Dec96) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; furnace</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
spinning --- starting and stopping oven rotation (DRAFT)
<p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
This document describes the procedure for preparing the oven for
rotation.  This is an operator's guide --- not an engineering manual.
Remember that many mechanical and electrical checks are made as part
of the preflight sequence before heating begins.
<p>

<h3>Step 1: PREPARE OVEN AREA FOR ROTATION</h3>
<p>
Clear Inside Pedestal Area.
<p>
Close and Lock Lower Door.
<p>
Insert Key in Control Panel Interlock Switch.  Leave it OPEN.
<p>
Clear Hearth Level Platform and Install All Railing Sections.
<p>
Make Sure All Personnel Are Clear of Oven Except Operator.
<p>
Insert Keys in Control Room Interlock Switches and CLOSE Interlocks.
<p>
Start with Rotation Control Panel Power Switches OFF.
<p>
Verify Main Oven (Casting) Power is ON with Wall Breakers, and that
each Drive is plugged into the appropriate beam-level three-phase twistlock.
<p>

<h3>STEP 2: MANUAL ROTATION FOR CLEARANCE CHECK</h3>
<p>
Set CONTROL Switch to MANual (very important).
<p>
Set Manual Speed Dials to Zero (000), counterclockwise.
<p>
Turn Each Rotation Control Panel Power Switch ON.  Warning Strobes
Should Begin Flashing.  Control Power Red Indicators Should Light.
These are labelled POWER #0 and POWER #2.  If not, Check that motor
controllers are plugged in to a live source.
<p>
You are now ready to move the oven to verify that there are no obstructions.
<p>
Turn Key in the Interlock Switch to CLOSED.
<p>
Press REVERSE (or FORWARD) Buttons to Arm Rotation on both drives.
Horn will sound.  Hold Button Down.
Green Motor Power Indicator Lights will come on.
<p>
Use manual control knob to set a fractional RPM speed.
Oven will begin to Rotate.
Use knobs to rotate the oven a full revolution at slow speed on each drive.
<p>
Then bring the oven to a complete stop.
<p>
Press the red stop button to disarm the drives.
<p>

<h3>STEP 3: TRANSFER TO DIGITAL CONTROL</h3>
<p>
Set DIGITAL CONTROL Switch to COMPuter.
<p>
Set Thumbwheel Switches to the Ultimate Casting Speed for Backup.
<p>
The R-computer should be running.
<p>
A schedule, preferably starting from zero, should be running in the
rotation zone on the VME computers.  The desired speed will be
displayed on the LED readouts by both of the R-Computers.
<p>
Allow 60 seconds for Digital Controllers to Reset and for R-computers to
load in the computer set speed.
<p>
Verify Computer Selected Speed on Both LED Displays.
        Display is X.YYY RPM.
<p>
Set CONTROL Switch to #1 to select the digital controllers.
(Do NOT use the CONTROL Switch in position #2 except for engineering tests.)
<p>
Press REVERSE (or FORWARD) Buttons to Arm Rotation on both drives.
Horn will sound.  Hold Button Down.
Green Motor Power Indicator Lights will come on.
<p>
If selected speed is zero (0.000),  No Further Warning Will Be Given.
Computer has Control of Rotation Speed.
<p>

<h3>TO STOP THE OVEN: </h3>
<p>
Press the Red STOP Button.
<p>
or
<p>
OPEN Any Interlock Switch; (both switches in the Control Room)
<p>
or 
<p>
Turn off Main Oven Power Breakers.
