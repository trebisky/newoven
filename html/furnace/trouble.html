<h3>TROUBLE (Nov) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 96</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
trouble --- description of common problems with the oven screen

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
	This help file describes some of the most frequently encountered
problems with the oven window system.  The recommended solutions are
also given.  If any of these problems reoccur frequently, you may be doing
something wrong.  The old name of this file was "problems".
<p>
<p>
 window gone
<br>
	If a window dies completely, move the mouse to the blue
background area and press the right mouse button to get the "rootmenu"
called MENUS.  Slide over to select the USER menu and then the OVEN
menu, then select the window type that you wish to recreate and
release the button.  Note that this does not "reset" a window; it
creates a new one.  Be sure that the old window is not still around;
otherwise you could wind up with two copies of the same window, which
is bad news.  Remember the old window could be hidden or closed (iconized)
somewhere.  The mailtool, perfmeter and clock are not
oven specific, so you get them from the SYSTEM - PROGRAMS menu.
<p>
	The most frequent window to die is <b>ximtool</b>, which
cannot deal with talking to two tasks at once.  You therefore should
be careful not to run <b>odisp</b> while a <b>ovenc</b> is running.
<p>
	To intentionally quit a window, move the mouse to the top
border of the window and hold down the right mouse button.  Select
QUIT.

<p>
<p>
 syntax errors
<br>
	If you start getting lots of syntax errors from an IRAF
window, try giving the cl command <b>flpr</b>.  <b>flpr</b> may be the
most useful IRAF task you ever learn.  If <b>flpr</b> doesn't work,
recheck the task parameters.  Otherwise, <b>log</b> out of IRAF, then
restart the window as above.

<p>
<p>
 frozen xgterm windows
<br>
	If a xgterm window "freezes up", it could be because
you hit 256 characters without hitting a carriage return.  This
usually occurs when you accidentally lean on the keyboard.  The window
will just beep at you when you try to enter more characters. <cntrl-C>
fixes this problem.

<p>
<p>
 green boxes on your ximtool
<br>
	After accidentally creating a little green marker box with the
mouse in ximtool, you can blow it (the box) away by simply moving the
mouse pointer to within the marker box and pressing the DEL key on the
keyboard.  

<p>
<p>
 mouse button initialization for imcur
<br>
	Unlike in the "good ol' days", mouse buttons are not easily
initialized for ximtool v0.5 under Solaris and X11 IRAF.
This means that if you attempt to access imcur from the <b>oven</b> program
to find an oven location, you cannot use the left mouse button to return.
Hit "t", "l", "w", "b" or "a" to return from the ximtool imcur mode.

<p>
<p>
 help for ximtool and xgterm
<br>
	There is not really much user documention for the IRAF xgterm and
ximtool windows.  What there is can be found on the web at:
http://astro.as.arizona.edu/www/r/iraf/local/doc/ in the files
xgterm.info and ximtool.info.
