<h3>NAME</h3>
trouble --- description of common problems with the oven screen

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
	This help file describes some of the most frequently encountered
problems with the oven window system.  The recommended solutions are
also given.  If any of these problems reoccur frequently, you may be doing
something wrong.  The old name of this file was "problems".
<p>
<p>
 window dies
<br>
	If you accidently type <cntrl-X> in an xterm window, you will
kill the window and whatever task is running.  This is different under
openwin than it was under sunview where <cntrl-X> would suspend the
task, but not kill the window.  Note that emacs traps <cntrl-X> as a
command and that <b>oven</b> does a "go back" if you type <cntrl-X>.
If you are running oven remotely, then <cntrl-X> will still force the
<b>cl</b> into the background and say "Stopped".  To recover, say "fg"
at the Unix % prompt.

<p>
<p>
 window gone
<br>
	If a window dies completely, move the mouse to the gray
background area and press the right mouse button to get the "rootmenu"
called WORKSPACE.  Slide over to select the OVEN menu, then select the
window type that you wish to recreate and release the button.  Note
that this does not "reset" a window; it creates a new one.  Be sure
that the old window is not still around; otherwise you could wind up
with two copies of the same window, which is bad news.  Remember the
old window could be hidden or closed somewhere.  The console cmdtool,
mailtool, perfmeter and clock are not oven specific, so you get them
from the PROGRAMS menu.
<p>
	The most frequent window to die is <b>saoimage</b>, which
cannot deal with talking to two tasks at once.  You therefore should
be careful not to run <b>odisp</b> while a <b>ovenc</b> is running.
<p>
	To intentionally quit a window, move the mouse to the top
border of the window and hold down the right mouse button.  Select
QUIT.

<p>
<p>
 syntax errors
<br>
	If you start getting lots of syntax errors from an IRAF
window, try giving the cl command <b>flpr</b>.  <b>flpr</b> may be the
most useful IRAF task you ever learn.  If <b>flpr</b> doesn't work,
recheck the task parameters.  Otherwise, <b>log</b> out of IRAF, then
restart the window as above.

<p>
<p>
 frozen xterm windows
<br>
	If a xterm (or gterm) window "freezes up", it could be because
you hit 256 characters without hitting a carriage return.  This
usually occurs when you accidentally lean on the keyboard.  The window
will just beep at you when you try to enter more characters. <cntrl-C>
fixes this problem.

<p>
<p>
 incomplete plot
<br>
	Often the graph in the graphics window associated with an xterm
will appear incomplete.  To flush the graphics buffer and complete the
graph select REFRESH from the top of the graphics window.

<p>
<p>
 frozen graphics windows
<br>
	If the graphics window of an xterm stops accepting keystroke
input and just beeps at you, that usually means that it needs a series of
REFRESHes and RESETs.  This assumes, of course, that you were typing valid
keystrokes.

<p>
<p>
 screwy cursor keys
<br>
	If you are using <b>ograph</b> or something else in the
graphics section of a gterm window, and you quit the window while
<b>=gcur</b> is active, then the cursor keys will not work in the text
part of the gterm window unless you put on caps lock.  This can also
occur if you control-C out of <b>=gcur</b>.  The solution is to go to
the submenu in the xterm window by typing
<cntrl-middle-mouse-button> and select "Show TEK Window".  Once the
graph is rexposed, you can exit the <b>=gcur</b> normally with a "q"
and everything will be back to normal. 

<p>
<p>
 no scrollbar
<br>
	If you want to see the scroll bar on your xterm window, press
<cntrl-middle-mouse-button> in the body of the window and select "Enable
Scroll Bar".

<p>
<p>
 mouse button initialization for imcur
<br>
	When pilot first logs in the mouse buttons are not initialized.
This means that if you attempt to access imcur from the <b>oven</b> program
to find an oven location, you cannot use the left mouse button to return.
Use "t" or "l" or "w" or "b" to return from the imtool.
	To initialize the mouse button, enter "=imcur" from the blue window.
Then type "t" in the imtool to return.  Then enter "=imcur" again in the 
blue window.  Then type <cntrl-left-mouse-button> twice.  Now clicking
the left mouse button will return the relevant r-theta-z coordinates.
	The <cntrl-left-mouse-button> trick does not seem to work with
ximtool version 0.4.  So, you must use "tlwba" keys to return from imtool.

<p>
<p>
 green boxes on your imtool
<br>
	After accidentally creating a little green marker box with the mouse
in ximtool, you can blow it away by simply moving the mouse pointer to
within the marker box and pressing the DEL key on the keyboard.
