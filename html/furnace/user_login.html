<h3>USER_LOGIN (Jul93) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; furnace</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
user_login --- procedure for user login for oven monitoring

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
This help file describes the USER STARTUP SEQUENCE FOR THE OVEN.
<p>
These instructions are for logging into crater or dorado remotely to
monitor the oven without having pilot control capability.  If you need
to startup the pilot programs, use <b>pilot_login</b> NOT this file.
<p>
These instructions assumes that crater (or dorado) is running and that the
oven network is intact.  These instructions also assume that the
on-board VME computers are running.  Defaults only work for <i>oven0</i>.
<p>

<h3>STEP 0: Connect to crater or dorado</h3>
<p>
<p>
 From a PC on the network:
<br>
<pre>
C: CD C:EM4010
C: EM
</pre>

<p>
<p>
 From another xterm window:
<br>
<pre>
cl> rlogin crater
</pre>

<p>
<p>
 From another computer:
<br>
% telnet crater

<p>

<h3>STEP 1: Login as yourself </h3>
<p>
The login starts with a blank screen that says:
"crater login:" or "dorado login:"
You must have an oven account.
<p>
After entering the username and password, this should give you a
window running IRAF
<p>
To logoff, say <b>log</b>.
<p>

<h3>STEP 2: Load the external IRAF packages for the oven.</h3>
<p>
You will want to load the <b>mirror</b>
package in each xterm window (or at least each one you plan to use).
<p>
<p>
 Example
<br>
<pre>
cl>
cl> mirror
mi>
</pre>

<p>
The "mi>" prompt indicates that the <b>mirror</b> package is loaded.
Type "?" for a list of the tasks in the active package.
<p>
 Example
<br>
<pre>
mi> ?
      odisp   oven    ovend   oveng   ovenw
      ograph  ovenb   ovene   ovenp   tcmark 
mi>
</pre>

<p>

<h3>STEP 3: Check to see if shared memory segments exist. (optional)</h3>
<p>
Check these with "ipcs".  There should be 3 segments, one each for on-board
computers v0, v1 and v2.
<p>
<p>
 Example
<br>
<pre>
mi> !ipcs
IPC status from crater as of Thu Jun  6 18:25:12 1991
T     ID     KEY        MODE       OWNER    GROUP
Message Queues:
Shared Memory:
m    300 0x00000100 --rw-r--r--    pilot    other
m    301 0x00000101 --rw-r--r--    pilot    other
m    202 0x00000102 --rw-r--r--    pilot    other
Semaphores:
mi>
</pre>

<p>
Shared memory segments must be created and initialized by pilot.
If they don't exist, the oven isn't running.
<p>

<h3>STEP4:  Check for the data and error daemons. (optional)</h3>
<p>
If you only want to check for the oven daemons, you can say:
<p>
 Example
<br>
<pre>
mi> !ps -aux | grep mirror		(shows all mirror tasks)
mi>
mi> !ps -ax | grep N			(shows all background tasks)
mi>
</pre>

<p>
For a brief description of the daemon's function type: <b>help ovend</b>
In normal operation, there are 7 daemons running.
Oven tasks appear as "/usr/iraf/mirror/bin.sparc/x_mirror.e"
The <b>cl</b>s in your xterm windows appear as "/usr/iraf/bin.sparc/cl.e"
Background tasks will have an "N" in the STAT column.  Note that each
background daemon has an associated <b>cl</b>.
<p>

<h3>STEP5:  Run the oven program.</h3>
<p>
<p>
 Example
<br>
<pre>
mi> oven readonly=yes
</pre>

The blue window will now continue the oven program talking to
the shared memory segment for v0.  If the v0 computer is functioning,
and <b>ovend</b> is running,
you should get fresh data each minute.
<p>
If an oven task crashes, use <b>flpr</b> to flush the process cache before
restarting.  <b>unlearn</b> resets the default parameters for the task.
<p>
 Example
<br>
<pre>
mi> unlearn oven
mi> oven ncomp=0
</pre>

<p>

<h3>STEP 6: Start the oven cron task. (if you have multiple windows)</h3>
<p>
Start the cron task in the purple window (border):
<p>
 Example
<br>
<pre>
mi> ovenc &
</pre>

ograph and odisp should now display data at appropriate intervals.
 
To stop the cron task or another daemon, use the IRAF kill
command in the relevant window: <b>kill</b> x
(where x is the job number [1-4])
