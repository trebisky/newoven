<h3> SOML control room software - command line options (linux version)</h3>

The IRAF hosted software provided various options as "cl" variables, in particular the
values of noven and ncomp are the most commonly specified.  This is now done in a different
and more terse fashion.  The following examples use the "oven" command, but this syntax
applies to all of the commands.

<p>
By default noven = ncomp = 0 which is the most common case, so typing:

<pre>
oven
</pre>

will launch the text based oven GUI in the way that is most commonly useful.

<p>
To specify a different computer (such as when setting up shared memory by hand), you use
the -c1 option in lieu of "ncomp=1", i.e. you would type:

<pre>
oven -c1
</pre>

The software allows for a multitude of ovens, but we use only 0 and 1.  Oven 1 is the meter-cubed.
As a shorthand for using -o1 for this, the option "-M" can be used and is encouraged.
It yields clearer output when using the "ps" command to look at running processes.
<br>
The oven GUI for the meter-cube could be started via:

<pre>
oven -M
</pre>

<p>
For the ovend command only, an option "-nol" is provided, which disables logging data to files.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<pre>
oven -o3 (Talk to non-existant oven number 3)
oven -c1 (Talk to computer 1 on the main oven)
oven -M  (Talk to the meter-cube -- identical to -o1)
ovend -nol (tell ovend not to log data to files).
