<h3> SOML control room software - processes and shared memory (linux version)</h3>

The "ps" and "ipcs" commands yield somewhat different information under linux.
Using the new standalone executables makes for lines in the
"ps" output that are easier to understand.
<br>
An example using the ps command shows the following:

<pre>
[pilot@linuxpilot ~]$ ps -alx | grep oven
0  1004  3740     1  20   0  11592  8828 -      S    ?          3:05 ovend -M
0  1004  3927     1  20   0   4008  2280 -      S    ?          0:28 ovene -M
0  1004 15963     1  20   0  11600  8724 -      S    ?          2:41 ovend
</pre>

Here we see an ovend and ovene background process talking to the meter-cube along
with an ovend process talking to the main oven.

<h3>Shared memory</h3>

The "ipcs" command is used to check on shared memory, exactly as on the suns,
but the output is substantially different:

<pre>
[pilot@linuxpilot ~]$ ipcs

We are interested only in the shared memory segments.
There are a bunch we don't care about.
These are used by linux for things that don't matter to us.
The trick is knowing which of these are relevant to the oven.
At the present time, the thing to note is that the "key" value is non-zero
for all of the oven segments.  (These also have a size of 263748 bytes,
which is unlikely to change, but not an easy number to remember.

<p>
We can let grep filter out all these entries with zero keys as follows:

<pre>
ipcs | grep -v 0x00000000

------ Message Queues --------
key        msqid      owner      perms      used-bytes   messages

------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0x00000100 163867     pilot      644        263748     1
0x00000110 98333      pilot      644        263748     2
0x00000101 163876     pilot      644        263748     0
0x00000102 163877     pilot      644        263748     0

------ Semaphore Arrays --------
key        semid      owner      perms      nsems
</pre>

The segment with the key "110" is for the meter-cube.
The three segments with the keys "100", "101" and "102" are for the main oven.

<p>
To delete a shared memory segment by hand, use the shmid in the following command.
<br>
This command would delete the segment for the meter-cube in the above example:

<pre>
ipcrm -m 98333
</pre>

<h3>What does the "key" means in the shm listings?</h3>

This is displayed in hex, which actually turns out pretty handy.
Every oven shm segment has 100 set.
No information there other than this is an oven shm segment.
The next digit is either 10 (for the M-cube) or 00 (for the real oven).
The last digit is the computer number.

<p>
So there are only 4 cases that should ever be seen in our current world:

<ul>
<li> 100 - main furnace, computer 0
<li> 101 - main furnace, computer 1
<li> 102 - main furnace, computer 2
<li> 110 - Meter Cube
</ul>

If there is ever a duplicate of a given key, something is wrong and needs to be cleaned up.
