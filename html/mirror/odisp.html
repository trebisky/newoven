<h3>ODISP (May91) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; mirror</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
odisp -- display oven information

<h3>USAGE</h3>
odisp

<h3>PARAMETERS</h3>
<p>
 noven = 0
<br>
The oven number of the shared memory segment which should be attached.

<p>
 ncomp = 0
<br>
The computer number of the shared memory segment which should be attached.

<p>
 information = ttmp
<br>
The information to be displayed for the oven.  This may be "ttmp"
(time averaged thermocouple temperatures), "htmp" (derived heater
temperatures), or "hpwr" (heater powers).
"Hpwr" may not be selected if "mold" <i>aspect</i> is also selected.

<p>
 aspect = base
<br>
The part of the oven about which to display the information.
This may be "base", "lid", "wall", "alum", or "mold".  "Mold" may not
be selected if "hpwr" <i>information</i> is also selected.

<p>
 date = INDEF
<br>
The date for the information specified.  This is entered as a
single number in the format "yymmdd":  2 digits for the year,
2 digits for the month, and 2 digits for the day of the month.
If the default INDEF is specified, use today's information.

<p>
 time = INDEF
<br>
The time of day for the information specified.  This is entered as a
single number in the format "hhmm":  2 digits for hours, 2 digits for
minutes.  If the default INDEF is specified, use the latest information
for the given date.

<p>
 display = yes
<br>
After forming the image from the data values, display the image or not.
<i>Display</i> = no is useful for computing several images of different
information without them being displayed.

<p>
 frame = 1
<br>
Display frame to be loaded.  This is passed on to task <i>display</i>.

<p>
 auto = yes
<br>
If auto-scaling is selected (default), then chose the minimum and maximum
display values to be the minimum and maximum data values which are used to
form the image.  If the display range is less than 5, make the range = 5
by adjusting the minimum and maximum display values.
Only if <i>auto</i> = "no" will <i>z1</i> and <i>z2</i> be used, in which
case the display range may be any amount.

<p>
 z1, z2 = INDEF
<br>
If <i>auto</i> is no, then use <i>z1</i> and <i>z2</i> as the intensity 
values to be displayed as black and white respectively.  An INDEF value
will cause the appropriate minimum or maximum image data value to
be used.

<p>
 showtc = no
<br>
If <i>showtc</i> = yes, then the locations of the thermocouples are
indicated in the displayed image by values which appear white.

<p>
 interpolate = no
<br>
This affects <i>information</i> = hpwr and htmp only.  
If <i>interpolate</i> = no, then the heater information is shown as a
constant value over the extent of the heater.  If <i>interpolate</i>
= yes, the heater information is interpolated to give a smooth display.

<p>
 order = 0
<br>
This value is passed to task <i>display</i>.  This is the order of the
interpolator to be used for spatially interpolating the image when it
is displayed.  The current choices are 0 for pixel replication, and
1 for bilinear interpolation.

<p>
 searchdir = ""
<br>
List of directories to search after the current directory to find the
input data files.  This may be a comma separated list, a template,
and/or a list file.

<p>
 datadir = "uparm$"
<br>
Use this directory to write out the image file which is then displayed
by task <i>display</i>.  If <i>datadir</i> = "", use the
current directory.  This allows different users to operate in the
same directory, yet keep their work separate.

<p>
 silent = yes
<br>
This silences the report of the minimum and maximum data values which
are used to make the image, and the report by <i>display</i> of the
minimum and maximum z-values.

<p>
 debug = no
<br>
Enabling <i>debug</i> causes a variety of diagnostic information to
be written to STDERR.


<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Information for some particular aspect of the oven is displayed in the image
window.  Lid, base, and mold information is (optionally)
interpolated from the data points, and extrapolated to form the image.
Wall information is (optionally)
interpolated and made to be continuous at the ends of the wall.  The wall
display is theta versus z-distance.  The image title identifies what is
displayed, and shows the image name.  The intermediate image
can be written to a directory other than the current directory.
X-y coordinate readout of the
mouse position can be enabled by key F6.  To hold the coordinate readout
constant while selecting another window, press the middle mouse button
while moving the mouse.

<h3>EXAMPLES</h3>
[1] Display the latest temperature information about the base.  Allow the
image to be auto-scaled.  Use directory "home$oven2/" for image storage.
<p>
	cl> odisp datadir=home$oven2/
<p>
[2] Display the interpolated heater powers in the wall at 1:30 p.m.
on March 17, 1988.
<p>
	cl> odisp info=hp asp=w time=1330 date=880317 interp+
<p>
Abbreviations may be used.
<p>
[3] Display the latest mold temperatures with a display range of 100 to 120
degrees C.
<p>
	cl> odisp asp=m z1=100 z2=120 auto- searchdir=DATA*
<p>
Note that <i>auto</i> must be turned off for <i>z1</i> and <i>z2</i> to
take effect.  Look for the data file in the current directory, then in
all DATA* directories.

<h3>TIME REQUIREMENTS</h3>
The images displayed are 64 by 64 pixels for the lid, base, and mold.
Approximately 4 seconds are required to interpolate all the pixels.
For a 128 by 128 image, about 11 seconds are required, 256 by 256, 40 seconds.
(Times for SUN3/160 with f68881.)  The wall image is 128 by 32.

<h3>BUGS</h3>
Sometimes the cursor must be moved to the image window to cause the
image title and x-y coordinate readout to appear.  The cursor readout
shows x-y coordinates instead of polar coordinates.  The x-y coordinates
may be transformed using command <i>xytran</i>.
If the thermocouple locations are displayed (using <i>showtc</i> = yes),
then no temperature or power values can be shown at those thermocouple
locations.
