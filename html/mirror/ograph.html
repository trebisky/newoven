<h3>OGRAPH (May91) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; mirror</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
ograph -- graph time dependencies of oven data

<h3>USAGE</h3>
ograph

<h3>PARAMETERS</h3>
<p>
 noven = 0
<br>
The oven number of the shared memory segment which should be attached.

<p>
 ncomp = 0
<br>
The computer number of the shared memory segment which should be attached.

<p>
 dateleft, dateright = INDEF
<br>
The dates corresponding to the left and right edges of the graph.
This is entered as a single number in the format "yymmdd":  2 digits
each for the year, month, and day of the month.  If the default
INDEF is specified, then the date is today.  The date is ignored
if the time origin is "now".

<p>
 timelorigin, timerorigin = ""
<br>
The origins for the time offset parameters for the left and right
edges of the graph.  If the origin is "" (default), the time offsets
are in the format "hhmm", and represent the time on the corresponding
date.  If the origin is "now", the time offsets are signed and in the
format "dhhmm", and they are with respect to the current
time (the date parameter is ignored).

<p>
 timeloffset, timeroffset = INDEF
<br>
The beginning and ending times for the graph.  If the offset is
INDEF (default), use the earliest or latest time available for the
data.  If the origin
is "", the time offset is just the time of day for the given
date, in the format "hhmm":  2 digits each for the hours and minutes.
24 hour time is used.
If the origin is "now", the time offset is a signed offset from the current
time.  In this case the format is "dhhmm":  0 or more digits for days,
and 2 digits each for hours and minutes.

<p>
 yhiorigin, yloorigin = ""
<br>
Origin for y limits.  The origins may be "average",
"mindata", "maxdata", "zero", or
"".  "Zero" and "" are identical.  "Average" is the average of the
minimum and maximum data values to be plotted.
"Mindata" and "maxdata" refer to the
values of minimum and maximum data values to be plotted.

<p>
 yhioffset, ylooffset = INDEF
<br>
The y-axis limits.  These offset values are added to their respective
origin values to produce the limits for the y-axis.  INDEF values with the
origin = "average", "mindata", or "maxdata" are taken as 0.  If the origin
is "zero" or "", then INDEF for these offsets causes the minimum or maximum
data values to be selected for the limit.

<p>
 info1, info2, info3, info4
<br>
The information to be plotted.  Up to four separate items any be
specified.  These may be
<pre>
<p>
<i>info</i>x    information                                location

<p>
</pre>
In addition, <i>info</i>x may be specified to be "imcur" or "=imcur".
In either of these cases the image cursor is displayed, and one may select a
particular heater or thermocouple to plot by centering the image
cursor on the location and pressing a key.  The following keys have these
meanings:
<pre>
<p>
If the images are in the standard display frames:
<p>
 frame   image
<p>
   1     lid
   2     wall
   3     base
   4     mold
<p>
then one may simply select the information by these keys
<p>
  key     <i>info</i>x
<p>
   t      ttmp
   h      htmp
   p      hpwr
<p>
</pre>
If the images are not in the standard display frames, one may specify the
information and the location by the following keys:
<pre>
<p>
  key      <i>info</i>x   location
<p>
   l       ttmp      lid
   w       ttmp      wall
   b       ttmp      base
   m       ttmp      mold
   L       hpwr      lid
   W       hpwr      wall
   B       hpwr      base
   M       hpwr      mold
<ctrl>L    htmp      lid
<ctrl>W    htmp      wall
<ctrl>B    htmp      base
<ctrl>M    htmp      mold
<p>
</pre>
The particular heater or thermocouple is identified from the cursor
location selected.
<p>
The temperature and power specifications require additional location
information as listed in the above table.  If no information should
be plotted, use <i>info</i>x = "".

<p>
 r1, r2, r3, r4
<br>
Radius.  This specification is for information of type
"ttmp", "hpwr", and "htmp".
The units are inches.  The radius along with theta and z identifies
the appropriate thermocouple or heater element whose information is
to be plotted.  The element nearest the given coordinates is the one
which is used.
This may be selected interactively by specifying <i>info</i>x = "=imcur".

<p>
 th1, th2, th3, th4
<br>
Theta.  This specification is for information of type
"ttmp", "hpwr", and "htmp".
The units are degrees.  The angle theta along with radius and z identifies
the appropriate thermocouple or heater element whose information is
to be plotted.  The element nearest the given coordinates is the one
which is used.
This may be selected interactively by specifying <i>info</i>x = "=imcur".

<p>
 z1, z2, z3, z4
<br>
Z-distance.  This specification is for information of type
"ttmp", "hpwr", and "htmp".
The units are inches.  The z-distance along with radius and theta identifies
the appropriate thermocouple or heater element whose information is
to be plotted.  The element nearest the given coordinates is the one
which is used.
This may be selected interactively by specifying <i>info</i>x = "=imcur".

<p>
 zone1, zone2, zone3, zone4
<br>
Zone specifier.  The zone names are "z1", "z2", ..., "z20", and "r".
Zone "r" is identical to "z20".  This specification is
for information of type "etmp", "ztmp", "zsct", and "xtmp".

<p>
 addr1, addr2, addr3, addr4
<br>
Address specifier.  The DNTX address of the TIC.
This specification is
for information of type "jtmp".

<p>
 factor1, factor2, factor3, factor4 = 1.0
<br>
A multiplicative factor to scale the particular curve.  This serves to bring
the various curves into the same range of values.  A scaled curve is
indicated in the title of the graph by an asterisk ('*').

<p>
 subsample = 1
<br>
Plot every n-th data value, for <i>subsample</i> = n.
This is useful for very long plots.

<p>
 timeunit = hours
<br>
Units for displaying time.  This can be "hours" for time of day in hours, or
"days" for day of month.

<p>
 timezeropoint = INDEF
<br>
This specifies the beginning of the time label on the graph.  The default
(INDEF) uses the times from the data files, and <i>dateleft</i> and the times
for the left to determine the time label on the graph.  If the
timezeropoint is 0, the data is selected from the  date and time parameters,
then displayed from a time origin of zero.  The time origin can be set to
a date (if <i>timeunit</i> = days) by giving the zero point in "yymmdd"
format.  If <i>timeunit</i> = hours, the time origin can be set to a time
by giving the zero point in "hhmm" format.

<p>
 searchdir = ""
<br>
List of directories to search after the current directory to find the input
data files.  This may be a comma separated list, a template, and/or a list
file.

<p>
 datadir = "uparm$"
<br>
Use this directory to hold temporary files.  If <i>datadir</i> = "",
use the current directory.  This allows different users to operate in the 
same directory, yet keep their work separate.

<p>
 append = no
<br>
Append to an existing plot.

<p>
 device = "stdgraph"
<br>
The output device.

<p>
 debug = no
<br>
Enabling <i>debug</i> causes a variety of diagnostic information to
be written to STDERR.  If <i>debug</i> = "yes" then the temporary files are
not deleted.


<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Plot the time dependent behavior of oven information.  Up to four items
may be graphed at one time.
The four items are represented by a solid line, a dashed line,
a dotted line, and a dash-dotted line.
Time is indicated in hours, temperatures
are shown in degrees C, power in power units, voltage in volts, amperage
in amps, rotation in rpm, and others in units. 
The graph title shows the date of the left edge of the graph and
identifies the four plotted lines, along with an indication if
the values have been scaled.

for zones 1, 2, and 3 for all of today.

<p>

<h3>TIME REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<h3>BUGS</h3>
Only four distinct line types can be displayed, thus limiting the
number of identifiable pieces of information that can be graphed to four.
<i>Append</i> = yes allows lines to be added to the graph, but there
remains only four distinct line types.
Only one y-axis label can be given.  If information of different types
is graphed, the y-axis label will be appropriate only for the first
line drawn.
