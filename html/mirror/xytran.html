<h3>XYTRAN (May91) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; mirror</h3>

<h3>NAME</h3>
xytran -- transform oven display x-y coordinates to cylindrical coordinates.

<h3>USAGE</h3>
xytran x y

<h3>PARAMETERS</h3>
<p>
 noven = 0
<br>
The oven number of the shared memory segment which should be attached.

<p>
 ncomp = 0
<br>
The computer number of the shared memory segment which should be attached.

<p>
 x
<br>
The x-coordinate reported by the oven display command <i>odisp</i>.

<p>
 y
<br>
The y-coordinate reported by the oven display command <i>odisp</i>.

<p>
 information = ttmp
<br>
The information which is shown by the oven display command.  This may
be "ttmp" (time averaged thermocouple temperatures) or "hpwr" (heater
powers).  "Hpwr" may not be selected if "mold" <i>aspect</i> is also
selected.

<p>
 aspect = base
<br>
The part of the oven which is shown by the oven display command.  This may
be "base", "lid", "wall", "alum", or "mold".  "Mold" may not be selected if
"hpwr" <i>information</i> is also selected.

<p>
 debug = no
<br>
Enabling <i>debug</i> causes a variety of diagnostic information to be
written to STDERR.


<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
The x-y coordinates from the oven display command <i>odisp</i> are
transformed to cylindrical coordinates.  The nearest (in 3-dimensional
space) thermocouple or heater (as appropriate) is identified by
its cylindrical coordinates, and the corresponding x-y coordinates
are printed.

<h3>EXAMPLES</h3>
[1]  Find the thermocouple near x = 19, y = 18 in the base.
<p>
	cl> xytran 19 18
<pre>
	cursor           xy=  19.00  18.00   rtz=  80 222  13
	thermocouple     xy=  19.13  18.20   rtz=  79 223  13
</pre>
<p>
The thermocouple is at radius 79, theta 223 degrees, and z 13.  
Coordinate x = 19.13, y = 18.20 marks the thermocouple location.
<p>
[2]  Find the heater near x = 24, y = 4 in the wall.
<p>
	cl> xytran 24 4 info=h asp=w
<pre>
	cursor           xy=  24.00   4.00   rtz= 133  67  24
	heater element   xy=  23.82   3.49   rtz= 133  67  23
</pre>
