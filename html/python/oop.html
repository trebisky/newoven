<h3> Python object oriented programming</h3>

I have programmed using objects in Ruby, Java, and other languages.
My aim here is to write an "executive summary" for myself, which
may of course be useful to others, describing basic OOP in python.
There are lots of subtle, esoteric, and even powerful details that I
am making no effort to describe here.

<p>
Python OO is not as succinct and pretty as Ruby.
Java of course is wretched in every way and any comparison would be moot.

<p>
The following official description is very good and worth reading.
Remember that everybody and every language has (apparently) different
words for talking about the same concepts.  Be aware and be flexible.

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html">Python docs - classes</a>
</ul>

<h3>Basics: classes and instance variables</h3>

<p>
To get started here is a simple place holder for a class:

<pre>
class Fish:
    pass
</pre>

The interesting thing here is the "pass" keyword which does nothing, but
satisfies python syntax so this will compile.  This can actually be useful,
serving much the same as a C "struct" with members being added on the fly.

<p>
Here is a class with an initializer (constructor method):

<pre>
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
</pre>

If we write this code, we create an object of this class:

<pre>
x = Dog ( "fido", 5 )
</pre>

This "Dog" object has instance variables (attributes) called name and age.
We can introduce class variables (attributes) as follows:

<pre>
class Fish:
    count = 0
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
	Fish.count += 1
</pre>

Both instance and class variables are accessed the same way (via dot notation):

<pre>
x = Fish ( "Barnie" )
print ( x.name )
print ( x.count )
</pre>

Note that we can add instance variables "willy-nilly" at any time to a single object
instance via a line like:

<pre>
x.abracadabra = "stop me if you can"
</pre>

There is some confusing (and I think broken) hokey pokey with accessing class versus instance variables.
Inside the class self.count accesses the instance variable and Fish.count accesses the class variable.
This is fine, and as it should be.
If there is no "count" instance variable, accessing x.count outside the class yields the value of the
class variable, which I find surprising.  Accessing Fish.count outside gives the class variable with
no confusion as it should.  If we have both class and instance variables of the same name, accessing
x.count gives the instance value (which makes sense), hiding the class variable.
In this case we must use Fish.count to access the class variable.

<p>
My advice is to avoid this confusion and always use Fish.count to deal with class variables.

<h3>Methods</h3>

There is nothing particularly magic about instance methods except for the annoying need
to inject "self" as the first argument.  So we can add a rename method to our Fish class
like this:

<pre>
#!/bin/python3

class Fish:
    count = 0
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.count = 99
        Fish.count += 1
    def rename ( self, name ) :
        self.name = name

x = Fish ( "joe" )
y = Fish ( "bob" )
print ( y.count )
print ( Fish.count )

y.rename ( "sam" )
print ( y.name )
</pre>

Note that the "self" vanishes outside the class when the method is called.
It is magically injected as a first argument by python inside the class.

<p>
Along with instance methods, python also has class and static methods.

<p>
Class methods get a first argument magically injected by python, but it
is "cls" rather than "self".  This allows a class method to access class
variables (class state).  

<p>
Static methods don't get any magic first argument at all.
So they can't access class variables, and of course they can't access
instance variables.

<p>
Here is example code that would add a class and static method to our
Fish class:

<pre>
    @classmethod
    def show ( cls ) :
        print ( f"cls: {cls.count}" )
    @staticmethod
    def pork ( arg ) :
        print ( "static: " + arg )
</pre>

Note that the methods must be prefixed with a "decorator" that indicate that
the method which follows is what it is.  Don't be tricked into thinking that
this is a comment.  These two methods would be used in much the same way,
as follows:

<pre>
Fish.show()
Fish.pork( "xyz" )
</pre>

Note that the only real reason to have static methods is to group plain old
ordinary functions as part of a class, which is namespace control along with
some logical grouping and organization.

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

Some tutorials act as though this is the essence of OO programming.
I find it to be something I essentially never (or only very rarely) use.
Don't get out of balance and work up tangled collections of classes with
zany inheritance hierarchies!

<pre>
class Cod ( Fish ) :
    pass
</pre>

Here we have a "Cod" class with a parent class "Fish" that it inherits from.
Enough said.

<h3>Dunder methods</h3>

These are methods with names that begin and end with "__" (you have already seen
the __init__ method, which is one of these).  There are a bunch of these that you
can read about.  Consider __str__.  What it does is specify code to be called when
someone does something like this with an instance of a class.

<pre>
print ( x )
</pre>

We could add code like the following to our Fish class:

<pre>
def __str__ ( self ) :
    return f"I am a fish, my name is {self.name}"
</pre>

We return a string that the print function will use.  The f"" syntax is one of the
ways python gives for printing formatted strings, something you can read about elsewhere.

<p>
There are dunder methods that help in setting up interators or generators.

<p>
Other dunder methods can set up infix operators like == or != for your class,
indexing operations like [] and the usual gang of prefix and infix operators
used for arithmetic (if you want to make your class really fancy).

<p>
A lot of powerful stuff lurks here, but I won't get into details.

<h3>private data</h3>

Python has no facility for making variables in a class or instance private.
The convention is to prefix such variables with an underscore, but this is
a convention and nothing more.

<p>
Python does offer something stronger that was clearly added as a slapdash "patch"
or afterthought.  If you use two underscores, python replaces the name (invisibly)
with "_classname__var".
This clearly avoids namespace collisions in certain cases, but doesn't yield privacy.

<h3>Fancy stuff</h3>

There are lots of details involving python modules, namespaces, and such that you can
read about.  You can copy a method reference into a variable and then place parenthesis
after it to invoke the variable as a function.  Like this:

<pre>
nu = Fish.show
nu()
</pre>

These are just objects and we can pass method objects around and place them in new variables.
We can place them in lists or into other instance variables or whatever.

<p>
Giving the name "self" to the first argument of an instance method is just a convention.
But it is a good one if you want others (or even yourself) to understand your code.

<h3>An example</h3>

For what it is worth (which is not very much), here is the sample code I used to
perform experiments when writing this page.  It does work, which is due diligence
on my part to ensure I am really understanding what I am writing about.

<pre>
#!/bin/python3

class Fish:
    count = 0
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.count = 99
        Fish.count += 1
    def rename ( self, name ) :
        self.name = name
    def __str__ ( self ) :
        return f"I am a fish, my name is {self.name}"

    @classmethod
    def show ( cls ) :
        print ( f"cls: {cls.count}" )
    @staticmethod
    def pork ( arg ) :
        print ( "static: " + arg )

x = Fish ( "joe" )
y = Fish ( "bob" )
print ( y.count )
print ( Fish.count )

y.rename ( "sam" )
print ( y.name )
print ( y )

Fish.pork( "xyz" )
Fish.show()

nu = Fish.show
nu()
</pre>
