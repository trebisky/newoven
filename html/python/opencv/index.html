<h3> Python and OpenCV</h3>

OpenCV is a "thing" apart from python, but it almost seems that python has become its
flagship platform.  On my Fedora system, I do this:

<pre>
dnf install python3-opencv
</pre>

And then I can import cv2 and am off to the races.
OpenCV make extensive use of numpy, which only makes sense.
