Notes by Tom T  6-21-2019

The only thing that gets compiled in here is
menus.c (yielding menus.o).

The files menus.ext and menus.vc are generated automatically whenever
the pieces of the menu system are regenerated.

menus.i and menus.m never change, they are included by menus.vc

menus.vc and menus.ext are included by menus.c
